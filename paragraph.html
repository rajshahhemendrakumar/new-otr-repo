        IMPORTANT - FOR SENIOR CITIZENS :
         From 1st September 2001 onwards, concession to senior citizens through PRS (Passenger Reservation
        System) shall be granted only on demand and not by default as at present. The demand for concession shall be
        made on Reservation Requisition form in the case of reserved tickets. In the case of tickets issued to senior
        citizens on concession, during journey the concerned passengers are instructed to carry some documentary proof
        showing their age or date of birth, issued by any Government Institution/Agency/Local Body. like Identity card,
        Driving License, Passport, Educational certificate, certificate from Local Bodies like
        Panchayat/Corporation/Municipality, or any other authentic and recognised document. This documentary proof of
        age should be produced if demanded by some Railway official during the journey.
        GENERAL CONDITIONS :
         The Railway Administration reserves seats, berths, compartments, or carriage in accordance with the rules
        and conditions published in the Coaching Tariff. A passenger seeking reservation of berth or seats should purchase
        tickets from the Railway Reservation Offices/Authorised Travel Agency only.
         Advance reservations are made generally up to 90 days in advance for all classes and all trains. The period
        of advance reservation (ARP) is exclusive of the day of departure of the train.
         At intermediate stations where the train arrives on the following day, such reservations can be done more
        than 90 days in advance of date of journey from the intermediate station. ARP is in relation to the date of journey
        from train originating station. In case of some Inter-city day trains, the ARP is less
         An individual can book only up to six passengers on one requisition form provided all passengers are for the
        same destination and for the same train.
         Only one requisition form is accepted from a person at one time. However, if onward/return journey are
        involved, 2 or 3 forms can be accepted for the same passengers.
         Accommodation will not be reserved without purchase of necessary journey ticket. No reservation of
        accommodation will be made on provisional basis.
         When berths are reserved for passengers, the intention is to provide sleeping accommodation between 9
        PM to 6 AM. During 6 AM to 9 PM, the passengers concerned, if required make room for other passengers in
        compartment up to its carrying capacity.
         Passengers are requested to quote PNR number which is printed on each tickets on the top left hand side
        for any enquiry or complaint relating to reservations.
         Reservation ticket issued by the computerised system against pre-bought ticket must be accompanied by the
        journey tickets on train. Similarly journey cum reservation tickets bearing zero amount are not valid for journey
        unless accompanied by the valid authority to travel authorising issue of such tickets.
         Allotment of accommodation is done by the computer as per pre-defined logic. Efforts are made to provide
        compact accommodation to persons booked under the same PNR on first come first served basis.
         The Railway Administration will endeavour to provide reserved accommodation but does not guarantee the
        same and will admit no claim for compensation for inconvenience, loss or extra expense due to such
        accommodation including carriages, not being provided or reserved carriage not been attached to a particular train.
        The supply of any particular type of carriage or the provision of a particular berth and seat is also not guaranteed.
         Departure time printed on the ticket is indicative for the guidance of the passengers. Passengers must
        ascertain correct timings from the Railway station on the day of journey. Such tickets are printed up to 90 days i
